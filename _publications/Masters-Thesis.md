permalink: /publication/masters-thesis
excerpt: 'CRISPR-Cas, a particular type of microbial immune response system, has in recent years been
modified to make precise changes to an organisms DNA. In the early 2000s scientists discovered
through the study of Streptococcus pyogenes, that a unique CRISPR locus (Cas9) exhibited specific
RNA-guided cleavage near short trinucleotide motifs (PAMs). Further research on Cas9 eventually
led researchers to create methods that actively edit genomes through Cas9-dependent cleavage and
to manipulate transcription of genes through engineered nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9). These
techniques have enabled new avenues for analyzing existing gene functions or engineering new ones,
manipulating gene expression, gene therapy, and much more.
While great strides have been made over the last decade, CRISPR is still prone to inaccuracies
which often generate sub-optimal editing efficiency or off-target effects. The primary interest of
this thesis is the investigation of targeting efficiency concerning changes in the guide RNA (gRNA)
composition. While many different factors affect the ability with which a given gRNA can target a
DNA sequence, we have focused our research primarily on the formation of the R-loop: the hybrid
structure formed when the Cas9/dCas9:gRNA complex binds to a host DNA site.
In our investigation, we have attempted to account for several experimental findings reported
in the literature as influential for binding efficiency. These include position dependence, base pair
composition dependence, and the effects of runs of consecutive mismatches. Using a Gamblerâ€™s
Ruin Markov model to mimic the process of R-loop formation, we fit our model to experimental
data and show that the match/mismatch configuration between the gRNA and the DNA target
allows for accurate predictions of R-loop formation in bacteria'

The concept of reinforcement learning as inference (RLAI) has led to the creation of a variety of popular algorithms in deep reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, most research in this area relies on wider algorithmic innovations not necessarily relevant to such frameworks. Additionally, many seemingly unimportant modifications made to these algorithms, actually produce inconsistencies with the original inference problem posed by RLAI. Taking a divergence minimization perspective, this work considers some of the practical merits and theoretical issues created by the choice of loss function minimized in the policy update in off-policy reinforcement learning. Our results show that while the choice of divergence rarely has a major affect on the sample efficiency of the algorithm, it can have important practical repercussions on ease of implementation, computational efficiency, and restrictions to the distribution over actions.
