PhD student studying the intersection of optimization and reinforcement learning under Mark Schmidt and Frank Wood at UBC in the department of Computer Science. I am originally from Boulder CO, and enjoy climbing, skiing, trail running, and mountain biking. My current projects focus on taking advantage of additional information in simulators for autonomous vehicles, and how to make popular deep-learning algorithms more stable in general continuous control environments. In the past I have researched the reinforcement learning as inference framework, and before that some mathematical biology.
