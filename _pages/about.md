Currently a PhD student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. My research is at the intersection of optimization and reinforcement learning. My current projects focus on designing optimization methods tailored specifically to reinforcement learning, and using the additional information available in simulation to learn safer autonomous vehicles controllers. I have experience in creating simulated training environments for autonomous vehicles, and have published work at a number of top machine learning conferences, including ICML, ICLR, and Nuerips. Outside of research, I enjoy climbing, skiing, cycling and backpacking.
