Currently an Applied Scientist II at Amazon where I have worked on LLM fine-tuning for reccomender systems and contact routing. I completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC in November 2024. My research was at the intersection of optimization and reinforcement learning, focusing on designing optimization methods tailored specifically to reinforcement learning, and using the additional information available in simulation to learn safer autonomous vehicle controllers. I have experience in creating simulated training environments for autonomous vehicles, and have published work at a number of top machine learning conferences, including ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. Outside of work, I enjoy climbing, skiing, cycling, and backpacking.
